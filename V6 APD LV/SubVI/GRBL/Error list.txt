### Error for GRBL 515000-515999 ###

Warning: 515001	Hard limit has been triggered. Machine position is likely lost due to sudden halt. Re-homing is highly recommended.
Warning: 515002	Soft limit alarm. G-code motion target exceeds machine travel. Machine position retained. Alarm may be safely unlocked.
Warning: 515003	Reset while in motion. Machine position is likely lost due to sudden halt. Re-homing is highly recommended.
Warning: 515004	Probe fail. Probe is not in the expected initial state before starting probe cycle when G38.2 and G38.3 is not triggered and G38.4 and G38.5 is triggered.
Warning: 515005	Probe fail. Probe did not contact the workpiece within the programmed travel for G38.2 and G38.4.
Warning: 515006	Homing fail. The active homing cycle was reset.
Warning: 515007	Homing fail. Safety door was opened during homing cycle.
Warning: 515008	Homing fail. Pull off travel failed to clear limit switch. Try increasing pull-off setting or check wiring.
Warning: 515009	Homing fail. Could not find limit switch within search distances. Try increasing max travel
